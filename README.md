# **Features**

This application features a simple way to create, edit, save, and delete notes as the user needs.

To run this application, clone a copy onto your pc by entering the following command in your terminal of choice:
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><br>git clone git@github<span>.com:Essence1987/notes.git</span></strong></p><br>
<p>Once the repo's copied to your device, upload it to your preferred server host and launch the given URL by your host.</p>
<p>If you wish to keep this program local, you can skip uploading it to a server and instead run it locally. Open up your preferred terminal, ensure your pointing at the correct directory, then enter the following command:</p></br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>npm start</span></strong></p><br>
<p>Now go to your preferred web browser and go to the following website:
